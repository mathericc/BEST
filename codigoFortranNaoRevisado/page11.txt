APPENDIX III
PROGRAM SPE

Program SPE is a FORTRAN computer program for the computation of
Species distributions from given Stability constants (and, optionally,
solubility products). The body of the program is extracted from the BEST
program with the added subroutine PHASE which takes into account
solubility products. The purpose of the program is two-fold:

1) To create an input file for a plotting program. In particular, the
plotting program included is SPEPLOT.BAS which uses as its
input the output file FORO07.DAT from SPE and drives the Hewlett
Packard LaserJet Series I! or Plus+ and compatibles to make
charts of % Species vs. p[H].

2) To create an optional FOROO8.DAT output file containing a
complete listing of each species, its stoichiometry, concentration,
and relative percentage all as a function of p[H] spaced usually at
0.1 p[H] unit intervals in a span usually 10 p[{H) units wide. The file
is optional because it is usually very lengthy. The file FOROO8.dat
is usually not printed but convenlontly perused within a word
processor wherein searches and other commands may be given.

When solubility products are not specified, program execution ts
extremely rapid. The specification of solid phases slows down the
execution because of the added computational overhoad of checking,
adding or subtracting matter. With extremely Insoluble spocios, problems,
if any, arise chiefly from FORTRAN precision.

The program was written and Is intended to be a complementary
utility to the visualization of solution composition as determined by known
Stability constants. SPE is particularly useful during work with BEST since
their input files are virtually identical. All of the illustrations of species

distributions were generated with the help of SPE.FOR and

SPEPLOT.BAS using a Packard Bell 232 PC, and drawn on the HP Series
ll printer.

FILE USAGE
Program SPE requires one input file, produces one output file directed at
plotting, and optionally writes a detailed species information file
containing concentrations, and relative percentages as a funotlon of
p[H*}: .
FORO001.DAT - input file (same as FORO04.DAT In BEST)
FORO07.DAT - output file (to be used by SPEPLOT)
FORO08.DAT - output file (for perusal or hard copy)
